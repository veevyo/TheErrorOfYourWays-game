# The Error of Your Ways
This is a game I made for my TAG Literature class.

To play, unzip the zip file. Then, navigate through your folders until you find a "bin" folder. Double click on it, then double click on the "Release" folder. Finally, double click the application file within this folder to play the game.

As far as I know, it only works with Windows out of the box.
